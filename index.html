<St. Martin's Island> By LOKKHI </St. Martin's Island>

<P>St. Martin's Island is a small island (area only 3 km2) in the northeastern part of the Bay of Bengal, 
about 9 km south of the tip of the Cox's Bazar-Teknaf peninsula, and forming the southernmost part of Bangladesh. 
There is a small adjoining island that is separated at high tide, called Chera Dwip. 
It is about 8 kilometres (5 miles) west of the northwest coast of Myanmar, at the mouth of the Naf River.</p>

<St. Martin's Island> By LOKKHI </St. Martin's Island>

<P>Millennia ago, the island used to be an extension of the Teknaf peninsula, 
but at a later time some portion of this peninsula got submerged and thus the southernmost 
part of the aforementioned peninsula became an island, and was disconnected from the Bangladesh mainland.</p>
